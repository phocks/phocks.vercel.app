# Micro blog

Testing out an idea I had for a static feed of posts that could be syndicated across different web hosts.

In its simplest form it is just a simple [JSON Feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org/) of date-ordered posts hosted somewhere on the web.

A client app can then "consume" those feeds and splice them together into a timeline.
